# Git Experiments

## git init

This is a repository to learn the nuances of git version control system.

Git repo always will have a .git folder created when we run

```
git init

```

If we remove the .git folder, that means, git will no longer monitor our repository. It will just turn out to be a folder.

```
rm -rf .git
```
